# Photoluminescence-from-DFT
This Python script computes and visualizes the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of a thin-film or single quantum well (SQW) material based on its absorption data and quasi-Fermi level separation. It implements the generalized Planck emission formula, incorporating absorptivity to account for reabsorption effects in thin films.
